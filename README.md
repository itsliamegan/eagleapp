# eagleApp

eagleApp was a schedule app I built for my high school in the 2019-20 school
year. Its showed the schedule for the current day, as well as allowed the
viewing of schedules for upcoming or previous days. It also provided a view for
days with irregular schedules, or vacation/professional development days.
